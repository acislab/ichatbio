iChatBio is a biodiversity chatbot created by [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/) and the [ACIS lab](https://www.acis.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. It is designed to help you find and retrieve information about biodiversity, biocollections, and biological species. It can provide answers to questions in the form of text answers, maps, species occurrence records, and links to more information.

Please keep in mind that iChatBio is currently a **prototype** under active development. It can do many specific things well, but making requests that it doesn't yet support can produce unexpected behavior. If you have a GitHub account, you may [create a new issue](https://github.com/acislab/chat.acis.ufl.edu/issues/new) to post questions, suggestions, or other feedback. You can also share your thoughts using the message box at ichatbio.org. The chatbot itself may be confused, but that's okay - the developers will be able to see your message. You can also send an email to admin@acis.ufl.edu.

## ü§ñ Contributing

iChatBio uses specialized agents to enable new capabilities like searching online databases or analyzing data. You can create your own specialized agent using the [iChatBio SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ichatbio-sdk). The SDK is a Python package which makes it simple to deploy an agent as a web server that can chat with iChatBio. All we need to connect your agent to iChatBio is the URL your agent is hosted at.
